Movie is really great. Maybe I liked it for actress,maybe for all the scenery,but i liked it.The whole atmosphere that was created.In one moment I just felt like I was in that university,in that room.It is not another drama movie that is made to win Oscar,it is just nice movie to watch in your free time.\",\n          \"When this movie was first shown on television I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I as experienced by American soldiers. Unfortunately this is not it.<br /><br />It should have been a good movie about WWI. Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and directing are badly lacking, even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies. War movie clich\\u00e9s abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that, even though there have been plenty of bad generals, most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie appeared to be \\\"Paths of Glory\\\" with American uniforms. Except that \\\"Paths of Glory\\\" was emotionally gripping. Later on there was Chamberlain's charge (except uphill) from \\\"Gettysburg\\\" and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from \\\"The Thin Red Line\\\". But in \\\"The Thin Red Line\\\" the soldier was alone when captured. In this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle.<br /><br />If this movie used a military adviser they ignored him. Even though the actors (and I never could forget they were actors while watching) mouthed military tactics I didn't see very much of it. The American soldiers would stand up to be shot while the Germans attacked. And the infamous Storm Troopers, who were apparently blind, appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack. In the real war, the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective. But the silliest scene was the attack of the German Flamethrowers. In this scene the German flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending Americans. If that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender's bullets.<br /><br />Okay, so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown. But it is still disappointing. But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti-war anti-military angle that movie makers seem to think is important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, even though they grumble and gripe, tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung-ho about it. My Grandfather served in World War I. And even though he died four years before I was born I have been told how proud he was of his service.\",\n          \"I bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning Brit sex comedy. I guess I should have read the finer print. I rarely write a panning review, but here goes.<br /><br />These actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. This comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.<br /><br />I repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick? Can the reference to the Austen classics 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility' be anything else? How much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? Are we meant to simply take it as a lay-down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on-screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces, too? I'm sorry, but I don't think so.

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no \\\"stars\\\" appeared in \\\"Ex Machina\\\" and \\\"Eva\\\", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.\",\n          \"Extraordinary and thought-provoking.\\n'Ex machina' is surprisingly dense, more so than other titles Alex Garland has written, perhaps excepting only 'Annihilation.' The simple concept is given a definite narrative, but that narrative pointedly explores the very nature of thought, and perception, and further broaching the nature and ramifications of morality. This is a psychological thriller, and in fundamental construction and in minute rendering alike, it is more intense than any other feature in the genre that I can name offhand, so much so as to almost classify as horror. The movie emphasizes and plays on dire uncertainty of intent, motivation, and reality all the way through to the climax, and even then leaves us with a somewhat ambiguous ending. And from ordinary beginning to captivating ending, at every point 'Ex machina' is absolutely marvelous.\\n\\nOf any performance I've seen from Oscar Isaac, none have been nearly so forceful as his portrayal of Nathan, exhibiting outstanding nuance and sharp personality in the realization of a man exceptionally intelligent, and exceptionally cruel and conniving. I'm not especially familiar with Domhnall Gleeson, but the Irish actor demonstrates admirable range and poise readily matching the same traits that are more immediately notable in his costars. And with that said - certainly not to count out anyone else involved - Alicia Vikander is phenomenal as Ava, showing a careful exactness to every motion and expression befitting the character, and impressing with her skills in the most subtle of ways.\\n\\nI love the score composed between Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, lending to the pensive unease about the film and building to a great crescendo at the precise appropriate moments. The sound design is exquisite - soft and unobtrusive, and with those qualities denoting both the meticulous craft of the feature, and the highly advanced status of Ava. So it is, too, with the special effects; to read a little bit of the production history informs of the substantial effort made to ensure every element of Nathan's creation was visualized with the utmost possibility of realism. And I think that endeavor paid off handsomely.\\n\\nThe characters as written are wonderfully complex, and the dialogue deceptively so. Garland's scene writing is impeccable and deeply engrossing, to say nothing of the overall narrative that delves into such heavy subject matter. Even being aware of the acclaim the feature had garnered since its release, I wasn't wholly sure what to expect as I sat to watch. What I got far exceeded anything I had imagined, mostly stepping away significantly from the common story ideas that populate most sci-fi films about artificial intelligence. Garland's screenplay analyzes consciousness with depth, completeness, and potency that I wouldn't have anticipated from a genre picture, and the result is so terrifically engaging as to be exhilarating. Factor in sound performances and excellent music, and 'Ex machina' is a firmly first-rate slice of science fiction that I call a must-see.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"IMDb Rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          10,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Sentiments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7.800000190734863,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
